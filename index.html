  <h1><b>Madlib</b></h1>
  <p>
      Today I went to my favorite Taco Stand called the <span id="1st"> </span> <br>
      Unlike most food stands, they cook and prepare the food in a <span id="2nd"> </span> while you <span id="3rd"> </span> <br>
      The best thing on the menu is the <span id="4th"> </span> <br>
      Instead of ground beef they fill the taco with <span id="5th"> </span>, cheese, and top it off with salsa made from <span id="6th"> </span> <br>
      With a <span id="7th"> </span> to go with it <br>
      Come get your tacos at the <span id="8th"> </span> taco place
  </p>
